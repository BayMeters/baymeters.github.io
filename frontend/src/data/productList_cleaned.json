Instead, it operates by utilizing two electrodes to measure the voltage generated by the movement of an electrically conductive fluid\u2014like water\u2014through a magnetic field. This eliminates the risk of wear associated with mechanical components, such as bearing degradation or other forms of mechanical wear and tear.\nBoth the electrodes and the liner of the electromagnetic flow meter can be manufactured from a wide range of materials, ensuring compatibility with various electrically conductive fluids, including aggressive and corrosive substances like acids.\nThe primary limitation of electromagnetic flow meters is that the fluid being measured must be electrically conductive, with a minimum conductivity of >5\u03bcS/cm. Non-conductive fluids, such as oil and other petroleum-based liquids, cannot be measured using this technology.",
